# Pixel Perfect Website

I built this project during my 1st at The Iron Yard Academy to utilize basic HTML and CSS techniques to build a functioning, pixel-perfect recreation of a PSD mockup. (Sidenote: Misspellings and inconsistencies were part of the assignment to ensure pixel-perfect)

###Tools Used:
* Static HTML for mockup.
* CSS properties for styling.
* CSS layout techniques such as float, display inline-block, & absolute/relative/fixed positioning.
* Google Fonts.
* Font Awesome.
